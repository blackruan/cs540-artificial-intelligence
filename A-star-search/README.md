## A* Search

In this assignment, I implemented A* search algorithm to solve a game problem, the rotation game, of which the details can be seen in the HW5.pdf. Moreover, different heuristic functions have been tried in the A* algorithm to get more sense of the performance difference between them.

The format of testing command will like this:
```
java HW5 <inputFileName> <modeFlag>
```
where **inputFielName** is the name of the input file which contains the initial state of the rotation game, and **modeFlag** is an integer ranging from 1 to 3, controlling which heuristic function your programm should use.

Sample input files are provided, which are **input0.txt** to **input2.txt**. Here is an example command:
```
java HW5 input1.txt 1
```
